				<h4>Monday</h4>
				<p>
					The mood was thrilling on this day!
					After a debriefing with Jimi the event began in earnest.
					It was really fascinating how the meetings were held this day.
					We had an introduction to special subjects such as Cybersecurity, Business Analysis and Code the future.
					The GenAI was quite alien ngl but was really interesting.

				<h4>Tuesday</h4>
				<p>This day was packed up!
					The sessions ran from 10 am to 6pm.
					They information was top notch.
					The dedication from Jimi, John and the whole team was really heartwarming.
					They really brought the "each one, teach one" alive

				<h4>Wednesday</h4>
				<p>The highlight of this day was the practical Cybersecurity session though filled with quite a lot of tech jargon but a good foundation to begin with.
					Another major highlight of my day was the talk from Lysa Banks. The enthusiasm in her delivery made the evening session quite memorable

				<h4>Thursday</h4>
				<p>
					The shining star for this day was the innovation session,
					we were honored with the presence of Mary and Andrew and they taught us a lot on how to present your ideas,
					The session did run well over lunch time though.
					We had another calm code the future session where Jacqueline Jones and her team gave us wonderful insights on web dev and career building in tech.

				<h4>Friday</h4>
				<p>
					The sessions for today were not that  technical.
					I was really grateful for the session on CV and employability,
					In the next talk on strategic and partnership management,
					Mr. Szczech was kind enough to give us further insight on choosing our paths in tech.
					What I enjoy most about the session was just this!
					they're holistic and well-rounded.
					I did spend most of my morning tinkering with my peers,
					(as we were told earlier in one of our soft-skills sessions),
					tryna get their 'you could do this, you could change that!
